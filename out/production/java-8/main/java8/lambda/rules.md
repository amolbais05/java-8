# Important Rules of Lambda
* If the body of lambda expression contain only one statement then curly braces are optional.
* The body of the lambda expression can be either a single expression or more statements.
* If we are using one or more statements as the body of a lambda expression, then enclosing them within curly braces({}) can be mandatory.
* Java compiler also infer the type of variable passed in arguments , hence type is optional.
* Lambda is used to implement functional interface in very simple and short manner.
